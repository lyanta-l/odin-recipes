    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrambled Eggs with Tomatoes is a beloved Chinese home-style dish, cherished for its vibrant color, refreshing taste, and simplicity. It's a quick and easy stir-fry that balances the savory richness of eggs with the slight tanginess and sweetness of ripe tomatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>2 Medium Ripe Tomatoes, chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Cooking Oil (or more, as needed)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Sugar (optional, to enhance tomato sweetness)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Water or Shaoxing Wine (optional, for fluffier eggs)</li>
        <li>Chopped Green Onions or Cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the eggs: Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add salt and water/Shaoxing wine (if using). Beat well with chopsticks or a whisk until the yolks and whites are fully combined and slightly frothy.</li>
        <li>Prepare the tomatoes: Wash and chop the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Scramble the eggs: Heat 1 tbsp of cooking oil in a wok or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Pour in the beaten eggs. Let them set for a few seconds, then gently stir and scramble until they are just cooked but still slightly moist. Remove the scrambled eggs from the wok and set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry tomatoes: Add the remaining 1 tbsp of cooking oil to the wok (add more if needed). Add the chopped tomatoes and stir-fry over medium-high heat for about 2-3 minutes, until they start to soften and release their juices.</li>
        <li>Season the tomatoes: Add salt and sugar (if using) to the tomatoes. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Combine: Return the scrambled eggs to the wok with the tomatoes. Gently stir and mix everything together for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the tomatoes are coated in egg and the flavors have melded.</li>
        <li>Serve: Transfer the dish to a serving plate. Garnish with chopped green onions or cilantro if desired. Serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
